This package provides links that attempt to comply with all [*Effective Dart*](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart) guide rules.

**Be consistent. Be brief.**

> *Note*: This package is inspired by the [pedantic](https://github.com/dart-lang/pedantic) package, which contains lints internally used at Google.

## Using the Lints

To use the lints add a dev dependency in your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  effective_dart: ^1.0.0
```

Then add an include in your `analysis_options.yaml` file:

```yaml
include: package:effective_dart/analysis_options.yaml
```

You can always specify a specific version instead:

```yaml
include: package:effective_dart/analysis_options.1.0.0.yaml
```

## Unused Lints

Following lints have been considered and will not be enforced by this package:

`lines_longer_than_80_chars` might be practical not to follow for many people.

`unnecessary_getters` has been [disabled](https://github.com/dart-lang/linter/issues/23).
